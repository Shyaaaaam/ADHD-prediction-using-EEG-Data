Preprocessing:
Notch filtering (50,60hz)
Band pass filtering (1-47hz)
Spike clipping (to prevent muscle artifacts and blinks)
ICA based feature exclusion (weighted with metrics from kurtosis)
Normalization

Feature extraction:
Time domain features: Morlet Wavelet, Hurst exponent, zcr, Hjorth etc.
Spectral Features: Phase amplitude coupling, engagement index, alpha/beta/theta power, tbr etc
global featuers: microstate features
Inter channel features: Coherence, Alpha asymmetry

Feature Selection:
SHAP --> ANOVA --> PCA

Model Training: CATBOOST vs XGBOOST vs RF ( currently looking into stacked ensemble methods)
Result interpretation and analysis using SHAP
