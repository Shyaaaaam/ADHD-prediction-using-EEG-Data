In our current work we are focused on understanding the fundamental signalling differences observed in EEG and where it stems from and how it can be used to accurately predict ADHD. 
By analyzing the EEG data through various aspects:
Time domain features: Morlet Wavelet, Hurst exponent, zcr, Hjorth etc.
Spectral Features: Phase amplitude coupling, engagement index, alpha/beta/theta power, tbr etc
global featuers: microstate features
Inter channel features: Coherence, Alpha asymmetry

We use SHAP based feature selection to identify which features are of importance and use ANOVA to further statistically calculate the most siginificant features which are fed 
into the CATBOOST model for prediction. We are also working on employing SHAP at the output level to interpret the core meaning of our results and make fundamental predictions
about the characteristics of EEG contributing to ADHD, which can further help pinpoint the exact signalling defects in ADHD and its relative source.
